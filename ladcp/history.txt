Development history

Changes in 10.8:

- introduced new values for data files. This allows to skip actions 
  if the data are not available
  values.ctdprofdata
  values.ctdtimedata
  values.navdata
  values.sadcpdata

- getbtrack.m  Changed default bottom track range accoding to bin length.

- calc_depth.m , default_parms.m Major changes to recover old functionality
  to calculate  ADCP depth from integrated W and surface and bottom track 
  data. Now also uses build in ADCP pressure sensor with a given 
  weight for the inversion. Changed color of depth plot lines.

- misc_cut_profile.m moved surface and bottom detection to calc_depth.m
  enhanced the plotting capabilitied for shallow casts.

- plot_results.m allow plot of bottom track data for shallower casts.

- calc_ens_av.m changed the way shallow cast get handled to switch to 
  p.avens = 2. Warning for avens = 1 some checks for bad data can not be 
  done and have caused the inversion to fail in some cases.

- replace.m IS WRONG! and causes the read_sbe to crash!!!
  this was fixed    read_sbe_cnv   now calls  nans.m which does the
  same as replace.m but with different arguments

- process_cast(stn) with a negative stn now calls  clear_prep(-stn)

- updated the seawater library to version 3.2 of 19-Apr-2006 


Changes in 10.7:

- startup.m
  moved m directory to last position so that modified
  files can be stored there
  I.e. if one changes a files from m/ladcp, please copy it
  to local m directory and modify there.

- rdiload.m, edit_data.m
  p.maxbinrange has no effect in rdiload anymore
  is moved to edit_data.m

- rdiload.m, default_params.m
  introduced to params.clear_ladcp_pressure
  to clear LADCP pressure records. If there is not CTD
  pressure record, w integration should be used for depth.

- simple_bar.m
  more colors possible

- rdiload.m, default_params.m
  added params.up2down that will control the resampling of the data
  for not synchronous pinging

- figload.m 
  It was noted that colorbars got lost in the fig saving process and
  that paper orientations were not ok. This appeared under versions
  7.4 (possibly others too). The problem was in the saving and loading
  of the fig files. After much browsing of mathworks support site
  I found a variation of the figure loading part that seems to work
  fine. At the moment implemented for >=7.4  but will be tested for
  older versions too.

- process_cast.m
  added several 'drawnow' statements
  since in new Matlab versions the figure was not updated until
  finished with everything

- plot_menu.m
  changed location of plot for OSX so that taskbar does not overlap

- process_cast.m
  Under OSX plots are saved as eps now.
  

Changes in 10.6:

- rdiload.m
  single ping errors were wrongly calculated when using ensembles
  with more than one ping
  errors were estimated too small by a factor of the number of pings

- besttlag.m
  Fixed warning in cases of NaN in the data. Should not make
  any difference in the result.

- saveres.m
  Added some header info.

- prep*.m
  Changed save commands to use save6.m
  THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.

- lanarrow.m  process_cast.m
  lanarrow.m converted to function

- bestlag2.m
  bug fix handling data set lengths

- read_sbe_cnv.m 
  nans.m was used in one routine. This should have been 
  replace.m

- prep_ctdprof.m
  was using deprecated field name for nmea_utc_time
