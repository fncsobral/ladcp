% load this data and convert to standard format
% we need the data:
%
% time in decimal julian days ( January 1, 2000 = 2451545 )
% pressure in dbar
% in situ temperature in degrees C
% salinity in psu
%
% time is stored as acolumn vector in 'timctd'
% the other variables as columns PTS in the array 'data'
%
%
% in this example
% we skip the header of the file and extract the PTS columns
% into 'data' and the time vector into 'timctd'
%
% you might have to convert depth to pressure in dbar
% and/or conductivity to salinity
%
% and you will have to make sure that the time is stored in Julian days
%
% in this example we add the julian day January 0 of the year of the
% cast to the time stored in the file
% THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR SEABIRD CNV FILES that contain the
% variable 'time in julian days'

% In our example the CTD cast recording began a bit before the
% actual down movement of the CTD. We want only the real
% down and uptrace of the cast. A good part of this will be
% done again in the main processing, but sometimes those
% routines failed and it was simple enough to do here.
%
% The extraction of this part is sometimes tricky. You might
% have to 'invent' your own methods to make sure that only the
% cast is extracted.
%
% Here we cut start and end of profiles to near sea surface.
% This is done by taking the maximum pressure
% finding the two values closest to half of this pressure
% on the up and the down casts and go towards the
% surface on up and down casts until one reaches either 2dbar or
% the last value
